    <p>Founded in 2023, the Great Eight fantasy football league began as keeper league amongst a small group of friends. Each year, the managers compete to win it all and avoid the ever-humiliating Toilet Bowl.</p>
  <p>While the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending obnoxious texts to the rest of the league for the next year, the champion manager also walks away with $350 and the last place manager must complete the league punishment.</p>
  <p> So.... will you be great or will you just be one of the eight?</p>
